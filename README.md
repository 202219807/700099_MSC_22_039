### Integrating Reinforcement Learning into Game AI: 
## Design and Implementation of an Adaptive Game AI System (MSC-22-039)

#### Research question: 
How can reinforcement learning be integrated into game AI to create adaptive and intelligent game agents? 

#### Implementation and Scope: 
- The aim of this project would be to design and implement an adaptive game AI system that uses reinforcement learning to create intelligent and responsive game agents. 

- The project would involve researching different reinforcement learning algorithms, neural network architectures, and game AI techniques to determine the most effective approach for integrating reinforcement learning into game AI. 

- The project would require designing and implementing a game AI system that uses reinforcement learning to learn from its interactions with the game environment. The game AI system would need to be able to perceive the game state, take actions, and receive feedback on its performance in order to improve its decision-making abilities over time. 

- The project would also require testing the performance of the game AI system against other game agents and evaluating its effectiveness in different game scenarios.

## MSc Project Topic Analysis

**Introduction and Aims and Objectives**

Between the introduction and aims and objectives, it should be clear to the reader, at least at an overview level, what to expect for the project. Objectives should be S.M.A.R.T. and appropriate to be able to drive the direction of the project and enable an objectives based evaluation.

**Background Context and Overview**

This should provide the necessary background context to enable the planning of the project. I can include (but not be limited to): Comparison of technologies, Alternative solutions, Comparison of Algorithms, Processes and Methodologies, and Legal, Ethical, Social, and Professional issues relating to the project.
All this narrative should be properly referenced to source material citations. Remember that a high class project will refer to background sources beyond just those on the Web.

**Expanded Specification and Analysis**

Consideration of the areas identified in your background should be subject to your analysis, identifying strengths and weaknesses of various approaches, using the outcome to evidence and support decisions about the direction of your project.

**Project Management Plan**

Task List and Time Plan, Risk Analysis, Project management aspects such as source control, issue tracking, kanban board, etc.

**References scope and presentation**

References should be cited in the body of the report using an accepted referencing format (University's preferred format is Harvard). Sources should be relevant with higher value being placed on peer reviewed sources such as academic journals and conferences.

**General Presentation of report**

Well formatted with care given to matters relating to proof reading (typos etc). Figures and tables should be labelled and cross referenced in the text.
